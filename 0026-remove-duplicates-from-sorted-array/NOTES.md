1. We take pointer 1 and pointer 2 at 0 and 1 positions respectively
2. We compare the values at pointer 1 and 2
3. If both are same , duplicate which means we need to replace the 2nd value with a different number
4. Pointer 2 is incremented until a unique number is found
5. Pointer 1 represents the position that needs to be replaced
6. When a unique number is found by pointer 2, we increment pointer1 and replace the element
7. Before incrementing pointer 1, it is at the position where element is comared with j and as j keeps on moving.
